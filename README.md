# zil

Requirements:
1. Pyzil (https://pypi.org/project/pyzil/)


Notes:
1. Could not successfully install Pyzil in WIN.
2. In Ubuntu (with Python 3.6.8), Pyzil installation failed initially due to inconsistent versions of
jsonrpcclient and Click (specified in the requirements.txt of Pyzil). Resolved it by
using Click==6.7 and jsonrpcclient==3.3.6.
